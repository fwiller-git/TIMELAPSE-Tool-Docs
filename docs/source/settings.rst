RECORD
^^^^^^
.. image:: images/record_button.png
This button will Start and Stop the Timelapse Recording. It is disabled until you've Saved and Selected a Capture Option

Interval (minutes)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: images/interval.png
This is the duration of time (in minutes) between each image capture. Default is 1 minute. Using the slider you can reach a soft minimum of 0.5 minutes, and by typing in the field you can reach a hard minimum of 0.1 minutes.      

.. note::
    The lower your interval, the more likely you are to experience hitching. Keep this in mind if you are experiencing performance issues

Capture Options:
================
Camera
^^^^^^
.. image:: images/camera_co.png
This will capture from the perspective of Timelapse Cameras, and enable the Camera Editor.

Window
^^^^^^
.. image:: images/window_co.png
This will capture the entire window perspective.

.. note::
   You can have both Camera and Window enabled at the same time to capture both perspectives.
