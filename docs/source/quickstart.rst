Quick Start
===========

This section will show you how to quickly start making timelapses

8 Simple Steps
-----

1. Save your project file. 
2. Open up the TIMELAPSE Tool n-panel menu (called TLTool by default).
3. Set your Capture Interval. (Default setting captures every minute)
4. Select a Capture Option. "Camera" will capture from Cameras in the Scene, and "Window" will capture the Entire Blender Window (like a screenshot).
5. Line up your Viewport and click "Add Camera" to place a TIMELAPSE Tool Camera at that location in your scene. (Adding and Removing Timelapse Cameras should only be handled within this menu)
6. Set a File Path (Default is a relative path next to your .blend file in a Folder called "Timelapse_Images").
7. Hit Record! When you want to stop recording, just click the Record button again or click the red TIMELAPSE Tool Icon in the bottom right corner of your Blender window.  
8. Click "Generate Video From Sequence", and Timelapse Tool will create a video from the image sequence you just recorded. (This uses whatever fps and resolution settings you currently have setup in your scene)
