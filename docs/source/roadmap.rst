Road Map
========

These are some of the planned features for future updates of TIMELAPSE Tool. All updates will be free for anyone who has purchased this addon.

* **Shading Presets:** save and load preset shading Lock settings (very useful for green-screen setups)
* **Per-Camera Settings:** currently all cameras share the same settings. This will let you change resolution, aspect ratio, shading options, etc. on a per-camera basis 
* **Camera Animation Helper Tools:** TIMELAPSE Tool cameras are free to animate just like any other camera in Blender, but I'd like to streamline this process specifically for setting up timelapse cameras
* **Visibility Editor:** Enable and disable objects from showing up in the timelapse capture
* **Alternate Compression Options:** eg: using jpgs instead of pngs
* **Improved User Interface:** As people use this tool and give feedback, the UI will be updated to support the workflows of active users. 
* **General Optimizations:** Lots of work behind the scenes to improve the performance of this tool. This will always be an active pursuit. 
* **More to Come** ...
